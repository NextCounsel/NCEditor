# NCEditor Example

This is a simple example application for testing the NCEditor component.

## Running the Example

1. First, make sure you've built the NCEditor component:

   ```
   # In the root directory (../):
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. Then, install dependencies and start this example app:
   ```
   # In this example directory:
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

This will open a browser window with the NCEditor demo where you can test all features of the editor.
